Nature's Vibe; a website to look for nature sites. I really enjoyed working on this. It has a search page for mountains where one could search for a specific mountain from a dropdown list. The website also features a national parks search page where you can search for a specfic park or view all parks. I made a connect page and join page in addition to those pages as well. I made the entire thing majestic to my eyes from the font to the colors. An interesting piece of javascript was fetching the Sunrise and Sunset, I mean wow. I had no idea there was a function to even do such a thing and I'm curious to learn more about JavaAPI.
